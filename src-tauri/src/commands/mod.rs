//! Tauri command surface.
//!
//! Every command is narrowly scoped and does one thing. The frontend cannot run arbitrary code,
//! read arbitrary paths or delete anything without going through one of these, and each one
//! revalidates its input before acting.
//!
//! Naming: snake_case here, camelCase on the TypeScript side — Tauri converts automatically.
//!
//! Adding a command means adding it to `generate_handler!` in `lib.rs` **and** deciding which
//! permissions it requires — see `crate::authz`. A command that mutates the filesystem, reads a
//! paid feature, or removes duplicates goes through `authorize` before it does anything else.
//!
//! `validate_path` in `files.rs` is the shared path guard. Anything that takes a user-supplied
//! path either uses it or has an equivalent check of its own; the tests below cover both.
