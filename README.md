A local-first disk space analyzer for Windows 10 and 11. It maps a whole volume with a real
sunburst and treemap, finds the files that are actually eating your disk, detects true duplicates
by content, and explains every cleanup suggestion before anything moves.

Built with **Tauri 2 + React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + D3 + Rust + SQLite**. No Electron.

```bash
npm install            # frontend dependencies
npm run dev            # browser preview (synthetic data, clearly labelled)
npm run app:dev        # the real desktop app (requires the Rust toolchain)
npm run app:build      # attempts MSI + NSIS build on Windows (unverified)
npm run test:all       # typecheck + frontend/licence/icon tests + build
npm run bench          # tree aggregation benchmark, prints real measurements
npm run rust:test      # Rust tests (requires the toolchain)
```

To scan **real files**, run the native app on Windows 10/11, not the browser preview. After
installing Node.js, Rustup, Microsoft C++ Build Tools (MSVC), and WebView2 (see
[Windows prerequisites](docs/installer.md#prerequisites)), run in PowerShell:

```powershell
rustup default stable  # downloads Rust and selects the default toolchain
cargo --version         # confirm the toolchain is available
npm ci
npm run app:dev         # starts Vite itself and opens the Tauri desktop window
```

Do not start `npm run dev` separately on the same port. Start with a small disposable folder:
scanning is read-only, but **native compilation and cleanup are not yet release-verified**. The
latest completed Windows CI reached native tests (214 passed, 6 failed); its build and installers
were skipped. Fixes for those failures await CI verification. See the release audit before relying
on an actual-disk run.

---

## What it does

| Area | What you get |
| --- | --- |
| **Scan** | Any fixed, NTFS, external or user folder. Live progress with files, folders, bytes, elapsed, current directory and ETA. Cancellable at any point. |
| **Visualize** | Genuine D3 sunburst (one ring per folder level) and squarified treemap, plus a virtualized file list. Click to select, double-click to navigate in, centre click to return to root, right-click for a safe context menu, breadcrumb and full keyboard navigation. |
| **Large files** | Filter by minimum size (>100 MB / >500 MB / >1 GB / custom), extension and last-modified window; sort largest first; reveal any result in File Explorer. |
| **Duplicates** | Staged detection: group by exact size → SHA-256 → optional byte-for-byte verification. Never by filename. Inspect groups, compare paths and sizes, select individual copies, exclude folders, see total savings. |
| **Cleanup** | Scan-derived file suggestions and a preview of exact paths. The native command requires a confirmed Recycle Bin move and paid authorization; permanent deletion is disabled. Windows safety and Recycle Bin behavior remain unverified. The browser demo never deletes anything. |
| **Entitlement** | A one-time licence and three-device limit are designed, but purchase delivery and activation are incomplete. Live sales are disabled; free core analysis remains available. |

## Commercial model

The planned model is a one-time purchase with lifetime entitlement and three device activations;
**it is not for sale yet**. No subscription is implemented. The 30-day offline lease and
revocation/recovery lifecycle need a verified end-to-end implementation before launch.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Configured price (not available for live purchase) | **₹1,499.00** (149,900 paise), one time |
| Devices | 3 simultaneous activations, deactivable and transferable |
| Updates | included for the life of the product |
| Offline use | a verified licence keeps working with no network for 30 days |

The one distinction worth stating plainly, because it is the one products usually blur: **the
purchase is permanent; the offline validation lease is not.** A licence that has not been re-checked
in a while says "re-verify when you can — your purchase is not affected", never "expired".

Every price, device limit and entitlement period lives in exactly one file on each side —
`src-tauri/src/config/product.rs` and `supabase/migrations/0002_rls_and_functions.sql` — and both are
validated on load.

## What it will never do

- Delete a file because it was selected or analysed.
- Auto-classify your documents, browser profiles, development dependencies or package caches as junk.
- Offer Windows system files or application data for deletion.
- Preselect every copy of a duplicate group — at least one copy is always kept.
- Upload scan paths or file contents. Core analysis is local; the licensing service is not yet
  wired end-to-end. Any future network functionality needs a separate privacy review and tests.
- Trust the frontend as a security boundary. Every paid or destructive capability is gated inside
  Rust, before the operation runs, against an entitlement the backend resolved itself. A modified
  React interface cannot bypass it, and a forged licence cannot unlock a paid command.
- Execute a file it has analysed, or grant the webview any shell-execution permission.
- Pretend to be code-signed. The installers are unsigned; signing is a separate release task.

## The transport seam

`src/lib/transport.ts` defines every operation the app can perform. Exactly two implementations
exist:

- **`tauriTransport`** — the product. Talks to Rust through narrowly-scoped Tauri commands and
  events. Selected when `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__` is present.
- **`demo`** — a browser-only fallback that serves a deterministic synthetic filesystem so the
  interface can be reviewed and tested without Windows. It is clearly labelled in the UI
  ("Browser preview · synthetic data"), reports `canMutate: false`, refuses every destructive
  operation, and is never selected inside a packaged build.

Nothing else in `src/` imports `@tauri-apps/*`.

## Documentation

  storage and entitlement layers fit together, and why.

- [`docs/installer.md`](docs/installer.md) — building the MSI and NSIS installers, and the signing
  situation.
- [`docs/privacy.md`](docs/privacy.md) — exactly what is stored locally and what leaves the device.
- [`docs/licensing.md`](docs/licensing.md) — the entitlement model, the payment provider, device
  limits and recovery, key rotation, and what has *not* been executed.
- [`supabase/README.md`](supabase/README.md) — the licence service: schema, functions, security model.

## Verification status

Honest summary of what has and has not been proven in this repository:

| Claim | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend typechecks (`tsc --noEmit`) | ✅ verified here |
| Frontend test suite (173 tests) | ✅ verified here |
| Production build (`vite build`) | ✅ verified here |
| Licence + webhook contract suite (31 tests) | ✅ verified here — runs in plain Node, no network |
| Browser preview runs and drives a full scan lifecycle | ✅ verified here (jsdom) |
| Tree aggregation benchmark over 250 000 generated files | ✅ measured here — see [`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md) |
| Rust compiles, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo fmt` | ⚠️ **not verified here** — no Rust toolchain is obtainable in this sandbox. Gated on GitHub Actions `windows-latest`. |
| Rust licence-lifecycle integration test | ⚠️ **not verified here** — same reason. It reads the same fixtures the Node suite passes. |
| Rust aggregation benchmark (`cargo run --bin bench`) | ⚠️ **not verified here** — same reason. |
| MSI / NSIS installers | ⚠️ **not verified here** — produced by `npm run app:build` on Windows. |
| Supabase migrations applied to a real Postgres | ⚠️ **not verified here** — no network access to Supabase. Gated on the CI `migrations` job, which also asserts the device limit is enforced and no client policy exists. |
| Edge Functions executed | ⚠️ **not verified here** — no Supabase project and no Dodo credentials. Their shared signing and webhook-verification code *is* covered by the 31 contract tests. |
| A real Dodo test payment yielding exactly one entitlement | ⚠️ **not verified here** — requires credentials. Documented as a manual step in [`docs/licensing.md`](docs/licensing.md). |
| Code signing | ❌ intentionally not done. Signing is a separate release task. |
| Licence recovery email delivery | ❌ **not implemented.** `deliverRecoveryLink` is a documented seam; no mail provider is configured. |
